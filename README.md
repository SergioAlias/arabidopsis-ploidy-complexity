### MSc Thesis abstract ðŸ“–

Polyploidy is a genomic event that involves the presence of more than two sets of
chromosomes, either from the same species (autopolyploidy) or from different species
(allopolyploidy). It is a very common condition in plants, especially angiosperms, and
it is associated with both phenotypic and molecular consequences. Among them, an
increase of transcriptomic complexity is emerging as a possible consequence of
increasing the ploidy level. Studying the _Erysimum_ genus has revealed that there is a
positive association between the transcriptomic complexity and the ploidy level of the
species within it. In this Master Thesis we intended to validate this association in the
model genus _Arabidopsis_, which includes both diploid and tetraploid species.
RNA-Seq files have been collected from the SRA database, and their processing
using bioinformatics tools has been carried out. Proccesed files have been assembled
de novo to obtain transcriptomes, and it has been studied if there is an association
between the number of expressed genes and transcripts and the ploidy level of the
_Arabidopsis_ species. The analysis determined that _Arabidopsis_ tetraploid species
have significantly higher transcriptomic complexity than the diploid species, thus
validating the hypothesis raised from the _Erysimum_ analysis.
